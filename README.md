# hello-world


Hi hi everyone!

My name is Saige ^^

A person of many skills I took Digital Design in High school, I go to college now for an Asociates in Theatre performance, and am now returning for a more in depth look at coding!

With my friends help I hope to be able to find employment as a coder and leave my current occupation that at the end of the month doesn't leave me any money to spare. :(
